Bill's Libs
==========

## A collection of utility libraries for java.

These libraries were designed to take away some of the headaches I've personally experienced 
coding in Java. The classes were originally developed quite some time ago, and the issues they 
were designed to address may no longer exist in current versions of the Java SDK. However, I've 
recently decided to bring them into the modern era so I can publish them to the Maven Central 
Repository, which will make them easier to use on client projects.
