bills-libs
==========

A collection of utility libraries for java.

These libraries were designed to take away some of the headaches I've personally experienced coding in java. The classes in com.doxsystems.util were originally developed quite some time ago, and the issues they were designed to address may no longer exist in current versions of the java SDK. main.java.com.billhorvath.libs.util.Strings contains a number of method contributions from other members of the DoX Systems team as well. The classes in com.billhorvath.* are more recent, and are entirely by Yours Truly.
